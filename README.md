User Service - Food Delivery System
The User Service is a key component of the Food Delivery System that handles user-related operations such as registration, login, and profile management. It is designed to be a standalone microservice that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Features:
User Registration: Allows users to create an account with their name, email, password, role, and status.
User Login: Authenticates users and provides an authentication token (JWT).
Profile Management: Enables users to view and update their profile details.
